* What problem does your app focus on?
When you search youtube, lyrics are not always available or apparent. Also, even if there are lyrics videos, sometimes the timing is too slow/fast.

* How does your app solve this problem at a high-level?
A one-stop-shop App for searching for videos and their lyrics.

## How to Use

User can enter an artist and song title which will play a music video as well as display lyrics.
Recently searched video thumbnails will appear after a search.

## Built With

* HTML5/CSS/Javascript
* Bootstrap 4
* Font Awesome 5
* Youtube API
* Musixmatch API

## Future feature deveolopment ideas: 

1. Cart for subscriptions with an optional premium plan that would allow users to get unlimited lyrics downloaded 
2. Firebase DB or alternative DB, when the user searches for lyrics, the data that is collected from the web app would then be exported to a app through google play store or apple store
3. Shows a list of top album tracksâ€™ as thumbnails when the user searches artist name
