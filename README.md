* What problem does your app focus on?
When you search YouTube, lyrics are not always available or apparent. Also, even if there are lyrics videos, sometimes the timing is too slow/fast.

* How does your app solve this problem at a high-level?
A "one-stop-shop" app for searching for videos and their lyrics.

## How to Use

User can enter an artist and song title which will play a music video as well as display lyrics. Recently searched video thumbnails will appear after a search, and you can go visit YouTube to view them.

## Built With

* HTML5/CSS/Javascript
* Bootstrap 4
* Font Awesome 5
* YouTube API
* MusixMatch API

## Future development ideas: 

1. Cart to buy music to support artists.
2. Firebase DB or alternative DB, when the user searches for lyrics, the data that is collected from the web app would then be exported to a app through google play store or apple store
3. Shows a list of top album tracksâ€™ as thumbnails when the user searches artist name
4. Instead of the thumbnail linking to the YouTube video, play it again within the site.
